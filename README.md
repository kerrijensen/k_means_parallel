# k_means_parallel
K-Means algorithm running in parallel processes to compare overall time complexities.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm with parallelized distance calculations using the multiprocessing module. The program reads 2D coordinate data from a file, performs clustering, and outputs the final centroid positions and point assignments. By leveraging parallel computation, this implementation reduces runtime compared to a standard single-threaded approach, making it well-suited for large datasets.
